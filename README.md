# Windows-OOSU10-Auto-Script
This GitHub repository contains a simple script that auto-applies some O&amp;O Settings to Windows

Use at your own risk! I am NOT responsible for anyone who downloads this and decides to run it.

Credit for the logic and function to the script used in older versions of Chris Titus Tech's WinUtil that had the "Run O&O ShutUp 10" Tweak available.
